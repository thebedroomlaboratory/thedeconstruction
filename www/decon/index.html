                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>The Bedroom Laboratory was setup by two housemates with an interest in design and electronics. We always talked about projects that would be interesting but never actually did one!</p>

<p>Why the name? Well we’re living in a small apartment and I think a lot of people can relate to squeezing soldering stations and tools into Lack furniture from Ikea (sponsor us!) in the corner of their rooms!</p>

<p>We started this website in order to document our progress as much as anything else. We made a couple of rules for ourselves when we started:</p> <br>

    <li>Everything we make would be published open source, so that others can learn and work with us on projects.</li>
    <li>As much as is possible the tools we use would be constructed by ourselves, even if they were from kits to start.</li>
    <li>We would do one project a week, a “school night session” as we call them.</li>

<p>The school night sessions are 3 hour blocks of time where we have to think of an idea, preferably a mix of hardware and software, design it, test and iterate. At the end of the 3 hours we order boards off one of the very inexpensive fab houses, no matter how rough it is!</p>
